# 🧼 CleanUps App – Zero Waste Montenegro

## 🌍 Project Goals

The CleanUps App is a mobile-first initiative developed in collaboration with [Zero Waste Montenegro](https://cleanupmontenegro.me/en/), a non-governmental organization focused on eliminating waste pollution across Montenegro. The app aims to empower local communities, municipalities, and individuals to participate in and track environmental cleanup events through a digital platform.

Our primary goals were to:
- Simplify event tracking and attendance for cleanup activities.
- Create a platform for users to contribute trash collection data.
- Foster engagement through gamification and social recognition.
- Promote sustainable behavior through meaningful UX and design.
- Collect reliable data for the organization to use in reporting and advocacy.

## 🎯 What We Planned to Achieve

Based on early user research, client interviews, and team discussions, we identified the following key features to prioritize:
1. **Event Tracking & Attendance** – Allow participants to view, join, and register attendance for cleanups.
2. **Trash Collection Data** – Enable users to input data (weight, type, photos) of collected trash.
3. **Event History & Map View** – Visualize past events and their impact using an interactive map.
4. **Gamification & Challenges** – Introduce user engagement through fun, competitive elements.
5. **Personal Stats & Achievements** – Track individual participation and offer rewards (badges, stats).
6. **Push Notifications** – Remind users of upcoming cleanups and voting on challenges.

Secondary ideas like “trash challenges,” “leaderboards,” and “tracking trash over time” were explored as time and scope allowed.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

To build a scalable, cross-platform app within a 10-week sprint, we chose:
- **.NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid** for mobile + desktop cross-platform development.
- **Microsoft SQL Server** (hosted on Azure) for robust data storage.
- **GitHub** for version control and team collaboration.
- **Figma** for prototyping and user flow design.
- **Jira** for sprint planning and user story tracking.
