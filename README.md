# 🧼 CleanUps App – Zero Waste Montenegro

## 🌍 Project Goals

The CleanUps App was developed in partnership with [Zero Waste Montenegro](https://cleanupmontenegro.me/en/), an environmental NGO dedicated to reducing waste and promoting sustainable practices across Montenegro. The app is part of a larger effort to support citizen engagement and make community cleanups more visible, impactful, and trackable.

### Mission Alignment

Zero Waste Montenegro’s mission includes:
- Promoting zero waste methodologies.
- Supporting municipalities and communities in sustainable waste management.
- Encouraging citizen action through awareness, tools, and community-building.

Our app aligns with these goals by creating a lightweight, engaging, and functional tool for cleanup event coordination and participation tracking.

## 🎯 What We Planned to Achieve

### Core Objectives

At the start of the project, we brainstormed and prioritized the features that would provide the most value within the available timeframe. After discussions with the client and a review of user needs, we decided to focus on:

1. **🗓 Event Tracking & Attendance**
   - Users can view upcoming cleanups and mark themselves as having attended.
   - Location, time, and participation stats are stored for each event.

2. **📍 Event History with Map**
   - Past events are shown on an interactive map.
   - Each event shows summary stats, images, and descriptions.

3. **📦 Trash Collection Data**
   - Basic input of collected trash (weight, category, photo).
   - Data is saved per user and per event for impact visualization.

4. **📊 Personal Stats**
   - Users can view how much trash they’ve collected, how many events they’ve joined, and other impact metrics.

5. **📲 Push Notifications**
   - To inform users of upcoming events and keep them engaged.

### 💡 Initial Vision vs Realistic Scope

While the original app concept included **gamification features** such as:
- “Weirdest trash” challenges
- Voting systems
- Point-based leaderboards
- Reward mechanisms

...we agreed early in the project that these features would be **out of scope for our current MVP**. They require complex logic, backend infrastructure, and frontend UX that exceeded our timeline and workload capacity.

We intentionally de-scoped these elements and focused on delivering a functional, usable foundation that:
- Solves the core problems for organizers and participants.
- Can be expanded with gamification elements in future iterations.

To build a maintainable and cross-platform solution, we used:
- **.NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid** – for cross-platform desktop/mobile compatibility.
- **Microsoft SQL Server (Azure-hosted)** – for persistent, scalable data storage.
- **Entity Framework** – for database interaction.
- **Swagger** – for API testing and documentation.
- **Figma** – for UI prototyping and user flow planning.
- **Jira** – for agile planning and ticket management.
- **GitHub** – for version control, branches, and collaboration.
